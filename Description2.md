## Objectives of the week

This week you'll step to a higher level of software development.
You will learn about things what make an object-oriented programming language high-level.
It's inheritance and abstraction.

## Init

Before you start reading about the themes of this week,
please finish your task you had on previous week,
because this task is based on that.

Movies v2.0

In this task you will have to upgrade your Movie and Person handler application,
using abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance.
Please, keep in mind:
not all the code snippets should be used (e.g. setters and getters),
but you have to write them.
Your task is to extend your application to be able to calculate prices and investments of buyable products.
In our store there are 3 types of products: movie, game and book.
People can rent any type of products, but can buy only movies and games: books are only rentable.
Every product has an identifier which is generated by the application itself.
There is another important modification since the last version of the application.
Person means NOT ONLY actresses/actors in this version, so it is strongly needed to be your application modified.

* After you modified your Person class, please add a salary field to it. It's an integer number.
* Create a class called Product.
  It is able to tell us how much money was the investment for the current product by getInvestment method,
  but there is a little problem:
  we cannot define how to calculate the investment, because it depends on the type of the product.
* Create an interface, called Buyable.
  A product which is buyable has a price, so add a method getPrice(), which returns with an integer number.
* The total investment of a movie can be calculated if you summarize the salary of each person of the cast.
* A Game is a product and is buyable and it can be pre-ordered or not (boolean).
  People who pre-orders a game can get it 20% less price.
  The total investment of a game can be calculated if you summarize the salary of each person of the staff.
* A Book is a product and has an author. The investment of a book is the salary of the author.
* Create an IdGenerator class.
  It has a static generate method which gets a Product as a parameter
  and returns with a generated String which will be the unique identifier for the product.
  If the product is a Movie, the id should start with MOV.
  If the product is a Game, the id should start with GAM.
  If the product is a Book, the id should start with BOO.
* Create a RentManager class which includes the main method.
  Create at least 2 instances of EVERY type of product and print out the investment of the current product.\
  Write a method which gets a List of Buyable objects
  and returns with the total preferred income
  by summarizing the prices of the products in the parameter.
* Person field in Product class means the person who rented the current product.

## How to prepare for week B

Create a small demo for your work.  
Collect all the topics what you have learnt this week.  
Define some questions related to Java and/or abstract classes and interfaces.
