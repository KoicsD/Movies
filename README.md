# Welcome to my first Java-project!

On **Week9A** at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/) we had to get acquanted
with [*Java*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
and [*XML*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).
Here is the work-alone project we should achieve it via.
Its main class is *MovieManager*, which makes a list of *Movie*s,
from wich each *Movie* has its own cast as a list of *Person*s.
Finally, data structure is printed into an *XML*-file.
Each object contributes to converting its data to *XML*-tagged string via its own method,
and a *Tools* class also helps this task.

[Task description can be found here!](Description.md)

Two weeks later, on **Week10A**
our task was to extend our work and create *movies v2.0*.
The new modell is about a store where you can rend [*Product*](movies/Product.java)s
(ie. [*Movie*](movies/Movie.java)s, *Game*s and *Book*s)
but only *Game*s and [*Movie*](movies/Movie.java)s are *Buyable*.
The new main class is *RentManager*,
which instantiates some products and prints out the investments.

[Here is the new task description!](Description2.md)

You can find my solution in [package *movies*](movies/).  
Please, [checkout *Week9A*](https://github.com/KoicsD/Movies/tree/Week9A) if you want to see *movies v1.0*.

In [directory *Description*](Description/) you can find
the *UML*-diagrams and sample files provided by mentors.
In [directory *SampleData*](SampleData/) there is [the output file](SampleData/movies.xml)
generated by class *MovieManager*.

[Here](Questions.md) you can find some notes about my questions.

[Here are my conclusions of Week9A.](Conclusion.md)

Thank you for following my work! :D
