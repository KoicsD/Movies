# Welcome to my first Java-project!

On **Week9A** at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/) we had to get acquanted
with [*Java*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
and [*XML*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).
Here is the work-alone project we should achieve it via.
Its main class is *MovieManager*, which makes a list of *Movie*s,
from wich each *Movie* has its own cast as a list of *Person*s.
Finally, data structure is printed into an *XML*-file.
Each object contributes to converting its data to *XML*-tagged string via its own method,
and a *Tools* class also helps this task.

Two weeks later, on **Week10A**
our task was to extend our work and create *movies v2.0*.
The new modell is about a store where you can rend [*Product*](movies/Product.java)s
(ie. [*Movie*](movies/Movie.java)s, [*Game*](movies/Game.java)s and [*Book*](movies/Book.java)s)
but only [*Game*](movies/Game.java)s and [*Movie*](movies/Movie.java)s are [*Buyable*](movies/Buyable.java).
The new main class is [*RentManager*](movies/RentManager.java),
which instantiates some [*Product*](movies/Product.java)s and prints out the investments.

Task descriptions and my conclusions can be found here:
* [Week9A -- v1.0](Description.md)
* [Week10A -- v2.0](Description2.md)

You can find my solution in [package *movies*](movies/).  
Please, [checkout *Week9A*](https://github.com/KoicsD/Movies/tree/Week9A) if you want to see *movies v1.0*.

In [directory *Description*](Description/) you can find
the *UML*-diagrams and sample files provided by mentors.
In [directory *SampleData*](SampleData/) there is the output files
generated by class *MovieManager* and *RentManager*.

[Here](Questions.md) you can find some notes about my questions.

Thank you for following my work! :D
