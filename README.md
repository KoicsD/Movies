# Welcome to my first Java-project!

On Week9A at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/) we had to get acquanted
with [*Java*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
and [*XML*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).
Here is the work-alone project we should achieve it via.
Its main class is [*MovieManager*](movies/MovieManager.java), which makes a list of [*Movie*](movies/Movie.java)s,
from wich each [*Movie*](movies/Movie.java) has its own cast as a list of [*Person*](movies/Person.java)s.
Finally, data structure is printed into [an *XML*-file](SampleData/movies.xml).
Each object contributes to converting its data to *XML*-tagged string via its own method,
and a [*Tools*](movies/Tools.java) class also helps this task.

[Task description can be found here!](Description.md)

You can find my solution in [package *movies*](movies/).
In [directory *Description*](Description/) you can find
the [*UML*-diagram](Description/movies_uml.jpg)
and [sample *XML*-file](Description/movies.xml) provided by mentors.
In [directory *SampleData*](SampleData/) there is [the output file](SampleData/movies.xml) generated by my code.

[Here](Questions.md) you can find some notes about my questions.

[Here are my conclusions.](Conclusion.md)

Thank you for following my work!
